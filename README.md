PROJECT
The project is called 60s-BAND-MILESTONE-PROJECT
Name of web site developer is Paul Rolfe-Barber.
For clarity, I (Paul Rolfe-Barber) will refer to myself in the third person and the web site owner as the client.
Paul Rolfe-Barber was tasked to create a functional yet user friendly website for a 1960s band, which he believes has been accomplished. The main purposes of the site are to promote, sell the band’s music and to provide presences at functions, parties, weddings etc. The band, originally from Los Angeles, now based in the UK are still recording but looking to expand on the functions side. This website should increase their exposure/revenue.
FEATURES
The website has a home page and seven other pages. The pages are listed below…
•	Home Page
•	About us
•	News
•	Pics
•	Tunes
•	Videos
•	Back Catalogue
•	Book Us
To assist in creating a functional yet user friendly site, the pages follow a uniform format as detailed below…
•	At the top of the page is the title of the page in yellow, Arial, bold text. With the exception of the home page, the page titles are the same as the link names. The ‘name’ on the home page instead of Home is (in bold) The Monkees - for the ultimate 60s experience
•	At the bottom left of each page’s content (not the screen) there are links to the band’s Facebook, Twitter and Youtube channel.
HOW TO USE THE SITE
Instructions on how to use the site are detailed below.
•	Home Page. This page is the page you would arrive if you were to type directly the website’s name or click on any link from a Google (or any search engine) search. From this home page you can click on any of the links which can find just below the title of the page you are currently on. The links are in white text against a greyish background. When you hover the mouse over a link, the colours invert and the cursor, becomes a hand image.
•	About us. This page gives a brief history of the band.
•	News. This page informs site visitors of latest news.
•	Pics. This page displays band photos.
•	Tunes. This page has some of the band’s songs that can be listened to. They are audio only mp3 files.
•	Videos. This page allows you to play the band’s videos which are in mp4 format. (I was only given one video from the course providers).
•	Back Catalogue. This page will allow to you to order the band’s music in three different forms, CD, vinyl or download.
•	Book Us. This page facilitates the booking of the band for functions/weddings etc. It is just a simple matter of entering the relevant details and then clicking on submit detail
•	To the bottom left of the page’s content is a link to the band’s social media accounts which are Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. To access these, just click on the desired site. For the purpose of this project the band is fictitious, and the links just go the sites’ home pages.
To run the site locally so that changes can be made can be accomplished by signing up for a free Github account at www.github.com – As the website developer, Paul Rolfe-Barber would provide support. Support would also be provided to the client when changes to the site are required. 
EXISTING FEATURES
The users can book the group subject to availability on the book us page by entering the details as requested by the form which is to be found on the Book Us page.
TECHNOLOGIES USED
The languages used in the creation of this website were HTML5 and CSS3.
FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT
On the Book Us Form
Details that have been entered will be reset on the clicking of the Reset Details! button. This will be done using JavaScript which is beyond the scope of this project. According to stackoverflow – the link is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40980932/reset-button-not-working-in-the-form-after-form-submit/40981453
reset does not work how Paul Rolfe-Barber wants it to which is to clear the contents of the form. As already stated, Javascript would need to be used to accomplish this.
The details will also have verification methods implemented. EG. You will not be allowed to enter alphanumeric characters in the phone/mobile fields.
On the Back Catalogue Page
On the back catalogue page, ways to order and and download and pay for the music will be added. This project is only for a static web site.
TESTING
The site has been deployed to the internet and Paul Rolfe-Barber has carried out testing by using the site in a live internet environment as a regular (and not a developer) user.
DEPLOYMENT
This site was developed using Gitpod and deployed using Github development environment.
CONTENT
The history that resides on the about us page was copied from Wikipedia – the link is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees
The entry was edited for the purpose of this project.
MEDIA
The photos and videos used in this site were obtained from codeinstitute.net.
