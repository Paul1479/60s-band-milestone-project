 <p>One sunny day in Los Angeles in 1965, American musicians Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork with English actor/singer Davy Jones, formed a quartet called 60s groove (changed from their first name of The Monkees), with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. This was on the suggestion of television producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically for the situation comedy series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The producers wanted to stick with the Monkees as they deemed the name catchier Our music was initially supervised by record producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.
We were initially allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for the first few months of our career whilst in The Monkees. This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Mike composed and produced some songs from the beginning, and Peter contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Michael. All four of us contributed lead vocals to various tracks. We eventually fought for the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name, acting as musicians, singers, songwriters, and producers.
