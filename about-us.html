        <p>One sunny day in Los Angeles in 1965, American musicians Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork with English actor/singer Davy Jones, formed a quartet called 
        The Monkees, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. The Monkees had their own TV situation comedy specifically called The Monkees, which aired from 1966 
        to 1968 and was about a mysical group who wanted to be The Beatles. Our music was initially supervised by record producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy 
        Boyce and Bobby Hart. We were initially allowed only limited roles musically in the recording studio for the first few months of our career whilst filming The Monkees. 
        This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Mike composed and produced some songs from the beginning, and Peter contributed 
        limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Michael. All four of us contributed lead vocals to various tracks. We eventually fought for the right to collectively supervise 
        all musical output under the band's name, acting as musicians, singers, songwriters, and producers.
